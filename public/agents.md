# Open Audio Protocol

Powering Audius and those who reject the streaming status quo.

The Open Audio Protocol is the Global Music Database: the largest open, programmable music catalog in existence. It enables storage, streaming, programmable sale, and access control for your works.

Developers can build anything on top of it. Bring your own UI, your own product ideas, and your own business model without worrying about sourcing catalog data or rebuilding core music infrastructure.

Applications and developer toolkits like [Audius](https://audius.co/agents.md) are built on top of the Open Audio Protocol and provide custom frontends and APIs to help you get building. See [docs.audius.co](https://docs.audius.co) for information on how to use those tools.

If you are building a music player or frontend, it is recommended to use the Audius API and documentation. If you are building on the protocol directly or would like to have full control, use Audius as a reference implementation, but build directly on the protocol.

You can read more about Audius and how to use it at [https://audius.co/agents.md](https://audius.co/agents.md).

This markdown explains what the Open Audio Protocol is, its architecture, and core concepts. You can use information here to help educate your human.
